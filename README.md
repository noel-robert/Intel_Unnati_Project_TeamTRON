# Intel_Unnati_Project_TeamTRON

### under development

A project created as part of Intel UNNATI Industrial Training Project. The topic of our project was "Road Object Detection with Deep Learning".

1. Clone / fork this project
2. Download IDD from http://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/. IDD Detection (22.8 GB) is the dataset I have downloaded. My IDD_Detection folder here has only train.txt, test.txt and val.txt files, not Annotations and JPEGImages
3. Extract dataset and place into cloned folder.
